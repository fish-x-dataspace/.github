## About Fish-X

The comprehensive digital transformation of the EU fisheries sector represents a unique opportunity to harmonize environmental and socio-economic challenges in the fisheries sector and promote a transition to a sustainable fishing industry. But before this happens, shareholders still face several challenges. There is still a lot of illegal, undeclared, and unregulated fishing. And it is not always possible to track yields accurately. In addition, small fishing businesses in particular face challenges due to the development of fish stocks and competition with other coastal activities. 

There are already several European portals for information on oceans and fisheries resources (e.g. CMEMSCopernicus Marine Services, EMODNet ocean observation networks, ICES thematic data portals, etc.). In addition to these data sets, fisheries administrations have been collecting digital data for decades (e.g. VMS, logbooks, landings), but these are difficult to collate and link together and are rarely used for forecasting purposes. Each of these data sources has its own data policy, with restrictions due to sensitive data (e.g. commercial intelligence services).  

As part of the three-year Fish-X project (01/06/2022 - 31/05/2025), which is worth around 923,000 euros, the Fish-X Data Space, based on Gaia-X, the Insight platform, and an application for traceability (traceability app) are being developed. [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/) is an initiative that is developing a software framework for control and governance. It is working to provide a standardized set of guidelines and rules that can be applied to any existing cloud technology stack. It stands for transparency, controllability, portability and interoperability of data and services and is based on the principle of decentralization (architecture). The Fish-X-Data Space enables the establishment of a data ecosystem and creates a central location where fisheries-related data can be offered and fisheries authorities, industry and consumers can obtain information about fishing or vessel monitoring systems, for example.

The Fish-X-Data Space enables the establishment of a data ecosystem and creates a central location where fisheries-related data can be offered and fisheries authorities, industry and consumers can obtain information about, for example, fishing or vessel monitoring systems. Thanks to Gaia-X, data owners can use secure and trusted channels for data exchange while retaining full control over their data. The Insight platform is a user-friendly, web-based interface designed to visualize fishing activities and make them understandable and traceable for the end user. Vessel locations, activity reports and environmental data are used to analyze the patterns of fishing activities. The traceability app aims to maximize transparency and traceability in European fish and seafood supply chains. 
The Fish-X project aims to help promote synergies between fisheries, authorities, supply chain actors and consumers, drive digital transformation in the fisheries sector (especially small-scale fishers) and contribute to the traceability and sustainability of food.

The project is being implemented by seven European organizations that include TransMarTech SH, EUTECH, OURZ, SCIAENA, CLS, WWF, LIFE, IIMRO and north.io.
